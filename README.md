**3 things you want to try during this course**
- I would like to try implementing a map or location API of some sort. This may be something that's really useful for our app project
- I would like to learn as many methods of styling as possible, outside of ordinary CSS. Last term we worked a bit with lottie to import animation files as code, I would be interested in knowing other similar methods of styling a site / app
- How to efficiently build components of an app or website, such as carousels, accordions, etc. Ways to quickly and efficiently built these components, or have them pre-built (bootstraps maybe? not sure)

**2 things you learned today**
- I'm quickly picking up on how to write and import certain components in react-native, such as View tag, Text tag, Pressable tag. They serve similar purposes as elements we've already been using, but I enjoy learning how to write these things in react-native; enjoy learning new coding languages
- Glad we went over linking and routers, this is something we touched on very briefly last term but I had mostly forgotten. Thankfully we went over this and I feel up to speed again pretty quickly

**1 word for how you're feeling**
- Gubernatorial
